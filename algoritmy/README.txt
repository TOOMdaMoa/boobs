1) Run Prepare Data.ipynb to prepare data for the w2v algorithm (optinal)
2) Then run FinAlg.ipynb for generating the model_packed.pkl (optiona)
3) Then you can predict items for each user in Order Function Example.ipynb

The algorithm only works for users who viewed at least one item that someone else viewed 
There are few approaches to extend this
